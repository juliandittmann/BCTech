Is there a way to develop/collpase all groups in one click ?

Can users run the Analysis on large tables? For example if they want to run some pivots on Customer Ledger Entries or Item Ledger

Can we use all fields of the table to analyze or just the fields that are visible on the page?

Can we drill-down into flow fields?

Will we have a graph for the next release?

Would it be possible to share a tab to other users ?

Will you enable these views to be bookmarked on role centre?

Will export to excel be added in the future to dump these out as pivot tables ?

Will it ship to Production environments with BC22 (or does being in public preview until october 2023 mean it ships with BC23)? 

Can Data analysis be also applied on PTE pages? 

What are limitations (we know about 100000 lines but what else)?
