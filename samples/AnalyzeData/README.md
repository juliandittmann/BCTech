# How can I use Data Analysis?
Data Analysis is meant for quick fact checking and ad-hoc analysis when you don't want to run a report, if a report for your specific needs does exist, or if you want to quickly iterate to get a good overview on part of your business.

In the following table, you'll find examples of usage scenarios for each main area in the Business Central application.

| Area    | Scenario | How Data Analysis can help | Data Foundation | Fields to get you started | Built-in report(s) | Try in Business Central (new in 2023w2) | 
| ------- | ---------| -------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------ | ----- | 
| Finance (Accounts Receivables) | See what your customers owe you, maybe broken down into time intervals for when amounts are due. | Open the Customer Ledger Entries list and switch on Analyze. Go to the Columns menu and remove all columns (click the box next to the _Search_ field). Turn on _Pivot_ mode (located directly above the _Search_ field). Now, drag the _Customer Name_ field to the _Row Groups_ area and drag _Remaining Amount_ to the _Values_ area. Finally, find the _Due Date Month_ field and drag it to the _Column Labels_ area. If you want to restrict the analysis to a given year/quarter, apply a filter in the _Additional Filters_ menu (to the right, just below the _Columns_ menu.) Rename your analysis tab to "Aged Accounts by Month" or something that describes this analysis for you. | [Customer Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=25) | _Customer Name_, _Due Date_, and _Remaining Amount_. | [Aged Accounts Receivables](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?report=120) </br></br> [Customer Statement](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?report=1316)  | [Click here to create](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/do?tenant=default&page=25&dc=0&bookmark=C_FQAAAACHnwg#open-analysisview=H4sIAAAAAAAAA-2bW2_aMBSA3_kVftweQCEUOuWNwdpVGhu9aNKekEkOwZpjZ76s5d_PSWlwEiSqTr3ssEef2CHfufhyjhE0g4iMU0jIOI6lFUaT5YZcWqoMqA7TE6sUCPOdwW1EjLLQiSW3mbg21EDUIaRLnOAiichcasNESqbugZMTcssSs45Ivx_2hqVgzRLYvqRo5kwIcAOF5bwUaKlMo3khErjzZDRNz6yIPYmSt-dK2jwiK8o11GTN0Tn7LY3fsRQ0e62419yLt9gAVT5jGATICH9tPeDJkFTHb50xk8KssRFOZWwzF7HkZpNjjMOK76vs1fDCUwx4E6uNzEChx3MLTy30Ri_kndWLG3jB33sm6Fix3DApXoXseS13zuWScjJlLvi0QyR9MpFJfYbB4aMt0hAr6f3mLt5g5fumWMqEs-U4K7a2NcIhgh0baizy7svkx3t0cFNYMoPVcj4cUvtNFCR4DVijQ2rBK8goE8Up8GWMqG32anym1zbiyXDkMfo_8S9Z8Zpy0Hs8dIBg3zK1gDWN9oB2IIX2BrzSU_COLngM2sHc2UG6Z08t7YXrPwbuQNLs9dGelhekmzKpNC_Wv7h5hEcSezs4d-ATK4ciYoxzzLxY9qZMl_UMrBNpGxJpVaLNibU20SZFWaGoOHvkRnJQ1M1C6KO0yYo8WFu42GO2BYwydKuEqsc9l1qzJa9HL4ZT2O4cfQy0M3rXq7bBlS-jw3wgnIFZywRt4SOH2gFmhINKkM-SJwi3CZ-EUZtWyR8J213uvgcSYmQVfWesPoPi8M8ZaE1TKECvIGY5g3pyGclNgIrtIxU_t7cGEc6h12v3ObE13kWAAdb1Yg_ryRGxDo-IdXRErKdHxPoBKytNu-eKJd2xNXJS3j33IYfBsBf0Pco3UDl6EmbZdVErj3WbFaVFGISD7mV_8fgS9hGoI_yvjp06sOqifD6T1Ty2Ytwh6-IfKDWtRPcDy6fFDfhieLbcJh5NKQCnL669fkVuLhx0_gD7Zh96DDMAAA&zip=1&base64=1&title=Customer+Ledger+Entries+-+Aged+Accounts+by+Quarter) (CTRL+click to open in a new browser tab) |
