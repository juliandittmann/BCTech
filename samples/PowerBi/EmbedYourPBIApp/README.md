# What is this embed app generator?

The _EmbedYourPBIApp_ code sample consists of two commandline programs:
* PBIPayloadGenerator, and
* PBIEmbedGenerator

You can use the code sample for quickly creating an AL app with AL objects that host Power BI content.

## PBIPayloadGenerator

The _PBIPayloadGenerator_ program takes an Excel workbook as input and outputs an XML file to be used by the _PBIEmbedGenerator_ program.

If you run _PBIPayloadGenerator_ without any parameters, you can see which parameters and switches it supports.

## PBIEmbedGenerator

The _PBIEmbedGenerator_ program takes an XML file from the _PBIEmbedGenerator_ program as an input and produces AL code for embedding the PBI artifacts specified in the Excel workbook/XML file.

If you run _PBIPayloadGenerator_ without any parameters, you can see which parameters and switches it supports.
