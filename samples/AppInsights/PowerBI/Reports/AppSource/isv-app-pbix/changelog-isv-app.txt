Welcome to the release notes for the usage app on Business Central app telemetry.

Below, you can see 
1) ideas for upcoming releases, 
2) the current state of vNext (the next version to be released), and 
3) release notes for all released version of the app since the initial release on appsource back in April 2022.


-------------
Pending teams
-------------
* Performance: (in 22.0/22.1) On page 'Database lock timeouts', added isolationLevel to SQL visual


-----
Ideas
-----
* Dataset: on all queries, link to AppDim. Add global filters, obsolete AppIdDim
* Administration: App inventory query needs a rework 
* Administration: Data in telemetry page, stats by app visual has data where app is empty, probably needs fixing in the dataset
* Performance: add filters on select performance pages to determine if an operation happened in a Job Queue entry run
* (pending 4 tasks below) Usage: Add global page filters on AppDim. Remove page specific filters.
* Usage: make 'Page views' page filter on AppDim
* Usage: make 'Locations' page filter on AppDim
* Usage: make 'Clients' page filter on AppDim
* Usage: make 'MAT/WAT/DAT' page filter on AppDim
* Top level? Single view on customer page
* Administration: Aged customers (on older versions)


Bug reported on Twitter
https://twitter.com/phenno1/status/1731977434034008216
it seems that PowerBI for apps does not count apps installed as part as BC upgrade to Inventory. If I update my app manually (via Admin portal) it is counted but if app is updated automatically, together with major BC update, it is not.


------------------
vNext (implemented, coming in the next release, probably available in the beta app)
Install beta app from: https://aka.ms/bctelemetry-isv-app-beta

Ideas 
-----
-	In some pages you print stack traces or error message. This is fine, but can we add the operationId, so the developers can use it in KQL for further analysis.
Good idea, also valuable for the VAR app

-	In the Performance report a percentile (95th) would be useful (like in Azure Portal Application Insights).
Good idea, also valuable for the VAR app

-	Is it possible to visualize performance degradation over days or weeks?
