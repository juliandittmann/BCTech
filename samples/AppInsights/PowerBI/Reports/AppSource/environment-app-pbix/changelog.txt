Welcome to the release notes for the usage app on Business Central environment telemetry.

Below, you can see 
1) ideas for upcoming releases, 
2) the current state of vNext (the next version to be released), and 
3) release notes for all released version of the app since the initial release on appsource back in April 2022.


-------------
Pending teams
-------------
* Database deadlocks page: need to fix URL (hide) for user telemetry id (unblocked in 23.1/23.2)
* Usage: Add user telemetry id to pageview pages and allow filters on this (when available in client telemetry)
Url (in v24)
https://businesscentral.dynamics-tie.com/?page=774&filter='Telemetry User ID' IS '<telemetry ID>'
* Usage: add role dimension to page views (when available in client telemetry)
* Usage: log search terms (opt-in) (when available in client telemetry)
* Usage: add license type on sessions page (pending bug fix from server team)
* Administration: Permission set changes (pending app team on adding permission set name)


-----
Ideas
-----
* Usage: Feature uptake page
* Errors: Show successful/failed authentication calls joined to web service telemetry to extract endpoint, http headers
* Errors: cross tenant comparisons of errors (is this normal?)
* Performance: cross tenant comparisons of performance (is this normal?)
* Performance: Recurring job queue jobs with long running SQL/AL/locks
* Performance: Database wait statistics page
* Performance: outgoing ws calls happening while session is taking database locks/in a write transactions
* Use KQL functions for user analytics: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/useranalytics
* Dataset: EventStatistics table, refactor to use TenantHashQuerySnippet
* Business event telemetry


Possible bugs
The "Last 7 days" and "Since Yesterday" values in "Outgoing Web Service Errors" are not calculated correctly. I filtered the dashboard to show only the last 4 days (and I know that 69 of these errors are from today) so it should show all 104 in the last 7 days and 69 in since yesterday)
Seems like this issue has more pages, at least
* Feature errors
* Outgoing WS errors

On Environment Inventory report: "Is Updated" and "Is Deleted" predicates needs to be updated.
